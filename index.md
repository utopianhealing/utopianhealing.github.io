utopian healing farm & spa is an imaginary QTBIPOC-centered farm and trans-friendly spa
located in liminal space (between what was and what’s next)
with “next” being a physical farm and spa on borrowed land.

utopian healing is the non-place we must cultivate within our minds and thru our network 
during these dystopian times
an initiative focused on 
building community for marginalized identities, 
bountiful mental health support and resources, 
food sovereignty, 
and constant critical assessment of our values and effectiveness.
